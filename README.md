### Chess.com live game to lichess.org analysis "impoter"

This is a really basic script.
I have hardcoded all the urls and DOM elements.

Steps:
1. Download the source
2. Extensions -> Developer Mode ON -> Load unpacked
3. (Optinally) Pin the extension
4. Play a game on chess.com
5. Right after the game finishes, click on the extension icon

It will:
1. Open up the Share popup
2. Copy the PGN
3. Open a new tab (lichess.org/paste)
4. Imports the copied PGN with the option "Request a computer analysis" toggled on.
5. Enjoy

Extension Logo is the same logo as the official lichess.org logo.
